# PyramidCreator

A simple web app for creating and viewing hierarchies in the form of a pyramid.

This was a quick project that I made due to not being able to find an equivalent or easy-to-use solution for creating hierarchy pyramids.

The web app can be accessed using the following link: https://pyramidcreator.netlify.app/
